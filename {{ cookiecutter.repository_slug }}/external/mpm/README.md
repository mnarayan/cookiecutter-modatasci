# Matlab Package Manager (mpm)

A simple package manager for Matlab (inspired by [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip)). Downloads packages from Matlab Central's File Exchange, GitHub repositories, or any other url pointing to a .zip file.

## Setup

Download/clone this repo and add it to your Matlab path (using `addpath`).

## Usage

### Install a single package

__Install without a url (searches FileExchange and Github):__

```
>> mpm export_fig
```

__Install a particular Github release (by tag)__

```
>> mpm matlab2tikz -v 1.0.0
```

__Search without installing:__

```
>> mpm export_fig -s
```

__Install from a url:__

```
>> mpm export_fig http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig
```
OR:

```
>> mpm export_fig https://github.com/altmany/export_fig.git
```

Note that for Github repo urls you must add the '.git' to the url.

__Overwrite existing packages:__

```
>> mpm matlab2tikz -f
```

__Install to a specific directory:__

```
>> mpm matlab2tikz -i /Users/mobeets/mypath
```

Note that the default installation directory is specified by the MPM_INSTALL_DIR variable in `mpm_config.m`.

### Install multiple packages using a requirements file

```
>> mpm -r /Users/mobeets/example/requirements.txt
```

Specifying a requirements file lets you install multiple packages at once. See 'requirements-example.txt' for an example. Make sure to provide an absolute path to the file!

## What it does

By default, mpm will install all Matlab packages to the directory specified by `userpath`. You can edit `mpm_config.m` to specify a custom installation directory.

If you restart Matlab, you'll want to call `mpm_paths` to re-add all the folders in the installation directory to your Matlab path. Better yet, just call `mpm_paths` from your Matlab [startup script](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html).

## Requirements

To run the basic version of mpm you will need a working Python installation. I recommend [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

To install repositories without specifying a url, you will also need the `lxml` and `PyGithub` packages (which you can install with `$ pip install ...`).

Finally, make sure you set `PYTHON_EXE` in the `config.m` file appropriately.

Note that `mpm` requires the absolute path to any files/directories.

## Troubleshooting

Because there's no standard directory structure for a Matlab package, automatically adding paths can get a bit messy. When mpm downloads a package, it adds a single folder within that package to your Matlab path. If there are no `*.m` files in the package's base directory, it looks in folders called 'bin', 'src', 'lib', or 'code' instead. You can specify the name of an internal directory by passing in an `-n` or `--internaldir` argument.

Mpm keeps track of the packages its downloaded in a file called `mpm.json`.
