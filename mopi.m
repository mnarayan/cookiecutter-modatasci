%mopi  Install generic package requirements
%   mopi(FNAME) installs the Octave Forge, MATLAB FEX and URL requirements
%   specified in file FNAME, with each line of the file corresponding to a
%   different package. Package types are determined based on the protocol
%   scheme given by the line of the file as follows:
%     * Line begins 'forge://'
%           Octave Forge package
%     * Line begins 'fex://'
%           MATLAB FileExchange package
%     * Line begins <other>'://'
%           Uniform Resource Location (URL)
%   If no protocol scheme is specified, MOPI will attempt to infer the
%   package type. For more details, consult the documentation for the
%   subfunction INSTALL_SINGLE, and the README for MOPI.
%   A dialogue box will ask for the location in which to install the
%   packages.
%
%   mopi() without any inputs will try to install from a file
%   'requirements.txt' in the present directory.
%
%   mopi(PACKAGES) with PACKAGES as a cell array of strings will attempt to
%   install the package specified in each string within PACKAGES.
%
%   mopi(PACKAGE) with a single string input not corresponding to an
%   existing file on the path will attempt to the package given by PACKAGE.
%
%   mopi(FEXID) with FEXID a numeric integer input (not necessarily of type
%   int) will install the FileExchange package with id FEXID.
%
%   mopi(..., PACKAGES_FOLDER) will skip the dialogue box and install the
%   packages into the directory PACKAGES_FOLDER.
%
%   mopi(..., PACKAGES_FOLDER, FIXPATH) allows the user to select whether
%   the packages should be added to the MATLAB/Octave path after
%   installation. By default, this is true. If FIXPATH evaluates to false,
%   the path will be left unchanged. PACKAGES_FOLDER can be empty ([] or
%   '', say) to force the dialogue box to appear. Note that by default, the
%   path is amended, but it is never saved. If you wish to save the new
%   path after installing the packages, you should call SAVEPATH.
%
%   mopi(..., PACKAGES_FOLDER, FIXPATH, DOWNLOAD_FOLDER) allows the user to
%   specify where the package resources should be downloaded to before they
%   are decompressed. By default, this is PACKAGES_FOLDER/.cache.

%install_forge  Install a package from Octave Forge
%   install_forge(PACKAGE) installs the package PACKAGE from Octave Forge
%   and sets it to load automatically on startup. PACKAGE can be the exact
%   name of a Forge package, or it can be prepended with 'forge://' as a
%   protocal scheme. It can optionally be postpended with a version
%   requirement on the package, which will be ignored and is intended to
%   provide forward compatibility.
%
%   If this command is run in any environment other than Octave, it will
%   silently do nothing.
%
%   Examples:
%       install_forge('forge://control');
%       install_forge('control');
function install_forge(package)
    % If we're not in octave, don't try to install from forge

%install_fex  Installs a package from the MATLAB FileExchange
%   install_fex(PACKAGE, PACKAGES_FOLDER, DOWNLOAD_FOLDER) will download the
%   package PACKAGE from Matlab FileExchange at
%   https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/
%   into a temporary file in DOWNLOAD_FOLDER/PACKAGE.tmp, then unzip the
%   contents into the folder PACKAGES_FOLDER/PACKAGE/. The input PACKAGE
%   must be a character string containing the numeric FEX ID of the
%   package. This can optionally be prepended with the protocol scheme
%   specifier 'fex://', and can optionally be postpended with the
%   alphanumeric actual name of the package, provided this is separated
%   from the package FEX ID number with a hyphen. The name of the
%   downloaded file and output folder correspond to the FEX ID only and not
%   any extra content supplied in the string.
%
%   If the downloaded file cannot be unzipped, it is moved as is into the
%   target output directory, PACKAGES_FOLDER/PACKAGE/. Otherwise, the
%   downloaded archive file is deleted after completion.
%
%   Examples:
%       install_fex('fex://55540-dummy-package', 'external', '.cache')
